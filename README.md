# Chatbot with TensorFlow and React
This project demonstrates the creation of a chatbot using a sequence-to-sequence model implemented in TensorFlow for the backend and a React frontend for user interaction.

## Backend (Python with Flask)
### Prerequisites
* Python 3.x
* Flask
* TensorFlow
* Other required Python packages


### Setting up the Backend
1. Install the required Python packages:

```
pip install flask tensorflow tqdm pandas keras
```
2. Create a Python script for the backend, e.g., app.py, and add the provided backend code to it.

1. Download and preprocess your dataset or use a suitable text dataset for training. Ensure it contains question-answer pairs.

1. Train your model using the dataset. The model should include encoder, attention mechanism, and decoder components.

1. Define the 'ask' function that takes user input, processes it, and generates responses using the trained model.

1. Run the Flask app using the following command:
```
python app.py
```
7. The Flask app will be available at http://localhost:5000. It listens for POST requests at the /ask endpoint and returns responses generated by the chatbot.

## Frontend (React)

### Prerequisites

* Node.js
* React
## Setting up the Frontend
1. Create a React app using create-react-app or your preferred method.

1. Add the provided frontend code to your React app, replacing the appropriate components.

1. The React app allows users to interact with the chatbot. It includes an input field to type questions and displays chat messages.

1. Make sure to adapt the React app's styles, components, and logic as needed to fit your project's requirements.

1. Install the required packages for the frontend:
```
npm install
```
6. Start the React app:

```
npm start
```
7. Access the chatbot in a web browser at http://localhost:3000. Users can type messages, and the app will send them to the Flask backend to generate responses.

## Dataset (Kaggle)
